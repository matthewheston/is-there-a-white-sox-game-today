    <p>
    Hello there.
    </p>

    <p>
    Here's what you need to know. There is a great website called
    <a href="http://www.isthereacubsgametoday.com">Is There a Cubs Game Today?</a>
    that exists for Chicagoans to check to see whether or not there is a game
    at Wrigley Field that day. As the creator of that site says, "if you're
    actually a baseball fan looking to know whether there is a game today, out
    of an actual interest in said game, this site is not for you.
    Mostly because this site only pays attention to home games." It was
    created as a "resource for the rest of us Chicagoans who don't really
    care enough about baseball to actually pay attention to the schedule"
    but who do care about the traffic backups and service disruptions
    that go along with the event of a baseball game.This site
    is based on that web site, but instead asks the question, Is There A
    White Sox Game Today? (At U.S. Cellular Field?)
